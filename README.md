# 🛡️ GearGuard – The Ultimate Maintenance Tracker

## 📚 What is GearGuard?

**GearGuard** is a web-based maintenance management system that helps companies track and manage equipment maintenance.

### Real-World Problem It Solves

Imagine you work in a factory with 100 machines. When a machine breaks:
- ❌ **Without GearGuard**: You call maintenance, they write it on paper, you lose track, machines break again
- ✅ **With GearGuard**: You create a request online, it's assigned to a technician, tracked in a Kanban board, and scheduled on a calendar

### Who Uses It?

1. **👤 User (Regular Employee)**
   - Creates maintenance requests when something breaks
   - Views their own requests

2. **🔧 Technician**
   - Views requests assigned to their team
   - Updates request status (In Progress → Repaired)
   - Sees their work in a Kanban board

3. **👔 Manager**
   - Schedules preventive maintenance (before things break)
   - Assigns technicians to teams
   - Views reports and statistics

### What is a "Project" vs "App"?

**Project** (`gearguard/`): The entire website
- Contains settings
- Connects all apps together
- One project can have many apps

**App** (`equipment/`, `maintenance/`, etc.): A feature/module
- Handles one specific functionality
- Can be reused in other projects
- Example: `equipment/` app handles all equipment-related features

## 🔄 Workflows Explained

### Workflow 1: Corrective Maintenance (Breakdown)
**Scenario**: A machine breaks, user reports it

**Steps**:
1. User creates request → Selects equipment → System auto-fills maintenance team
2. Status = "New" → Appears in Kanban board
3. Technician assigns self → Status → "In Progress"
4. Technician enters duration → Status → "Repaired"
5. Request is complete

**Models Used**: Equipment, MaintenanceRequest, MaintenanceTeam

### Workflow 2: Preventive Maintenance
**Scenario**: Manager schedules regular maintenance

**Steps**:
1. Manager creates request → Selects "Preventive" type
2. Sets scheduled date → Request appears on Calendar
3. Technician performs task on scheduled date
